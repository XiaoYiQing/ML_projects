I want to write a classification function which determines if a food is considered healthy or not.

Obviously, we need to create a food class which describes the food item.
The properties of a food item are its nutrients facts.
However, the classification into either healthy or unhealthy will be based on a combination of factors:
	- Nutrients meeting certain conditions
	- General public bias regarding certain food 
		(For example, multi-grain bread, many types of yogurt, etc. which shouldn't but are considered healthy.)
	- My own perception
		(For example, Rice for life.)

	The idea has changed to something more straightforward.
	Instead of categorizing food products into health and unhealthy foods, we are simply going to categorize
	them into 5 major food groups.
	
	The 5 major food groups are:

	> The plan has finally been completed: I have a neural network (NN) that predicts a food's 
		category with an accuracy of above 90%.
	> I should now check how to put regularization, as the NN fitting might be way too tight.
	> The above also require a way to visualize how the NN is drawing the line of decision.
